      "This is a REST API for an application called “myFlix” that interacts with
      a database that stores data about different movies. The target audience
      for this API are front end developers who will build interactive front end
      designs that utilise this API. Another target group are movie lovers who
      appreciate an app that helps list all the information they need about
      their favorite movies"
    </p>
    <p>
      It will consist of a well-designed REST API and architected database built
      using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The REST API will be
      accessed via commonly used HTTP methods like GET and POST. Similar methods
      (CRUD) will be used to retrieve data from your database and store that
      data in a non-relational way.
